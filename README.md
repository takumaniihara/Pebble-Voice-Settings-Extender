I am reaching out to you about your post on GooglePlus and GitHub regarding your extension of the dictation API's functionality to include other languages.

We appreciate your interest and contributions to the Pebble community.  

Unfortunately, there are some licensing issues associated with this.

We would ask that you please remove your exposed framework from GitHub and GooglePlus as a result.

Before I remove my sourcecode and apk file from github and G+, I have
two question.

First, which license are you talking about?
Could you please tell me which license and where that I'm doing wrong?

Second, when Yakou Tetsu asked about changing the value of the
database of the pebble app and add unsupported voice language, pebble
support replied that "there is no licensing issue or anything" .

My question is why changing the database is ok and using xposed frame
work is not ok.

Thank you for your quick response.  

From the standpoint of your exposed framework, it is against Pebble's end user license agreement and developer terms of use.  The licensing issues I referred to are a result of legal agreements that Pebble has with third parties.  

There is also the same issue with the database change, and I will follow up with Yakou on that.  Thanks for letting me know.

I have deleted the source code and apk from the github and edited the
post on google plus that exposed framework has license issue.
Thanks for letting me know that I was doing wrong, and I hope pebble
would add many many language support on the platform soon.
